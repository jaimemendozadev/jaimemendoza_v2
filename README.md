## Initial Setup

Open up your terminal and clone the repo locally to your computer by running the following command at the target destination: `$ git clone https://github.com/jaimemendozadev/jaimemendoza_v2.git`


## Starting the App
This project uses the [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). Go to the Yarn website to learn more about how to install the package manger on your computer.

In the root of the app, use your terminal to run `$ yarn install` to install all the app dependencies. Wait until everything finishes loading.

Finally in the first terminal tab, or in another opened terminal tab, run the command `$ yarn run start` to start the app.

Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your favorite browser to view the website. 

Remember, you can always stop the server from running by typing `Control + z` in the terminal window you used to start the app.
